ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Michael (@Michaell14), 
  
  a freshman attending the University of Pennsylvania and pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I am interested in all kinds of technology and I love programming! I am a big music enthusiast (Current Rotation: Gracie Abrams, A$AP Mob, Drake) and I love finding something new to listen to. I'm also an avid anime/manga enjoyer who goes to the gym and likes to thrift. You can reach me through my email: limichael909@gmail.com
